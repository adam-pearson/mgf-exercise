# MGF Exercise

For this exercise, I completed the following:

**Front end**
- [x] Display contacts
- [x] Implement sorting & filtering of contacts
- [x] Add a form to add a new contact
- [x] Add a form to edit an existing contact

**Back end**
 - [x] Load contacts from the database
 - [x] Code to add a new contact to the db
 - [x] Code to update a contact in the db

## Setup Instructions

 1. Clone the repo
 2. Set up a database and import the .sql dump (I modified the SQL file to add a comma and turn the table IDs into auto-incrementing primary keys)
 3. Run ```composer install``` and ```npm install```
 4. Create a .env file using .env.example, making sure to set DB credentials
 5. Generate an app key with ```php artisan key:generate```
 6.  Run XAMPP and set your apache's httpd.conf to the cloned repo's /public/ directory
